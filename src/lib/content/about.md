I work at the intersection of art, design and technology.

I believe that the ingredients for understanding complex concepts are curiosity, exploration, playability and a pinch of humour. That's why at [The Ministry of Extraordinary Affairs](https://theministry.co), I build interactive experiences that _âœ¨spark joy_.

I specialise in conceptual design and engineering of interactive products and experiences, blending the digital and physical realms. I work with a range of creative, embedded and front-end technologies.

I work with brands, (creative) industry and education. I am currently _available_ for interesting projects or freelance work!
